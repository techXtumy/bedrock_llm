# Bedrock LLM Architecture

The Bedrock LLM library is designed as a comprehensive solution for building LLM-powered applications using Amazon Bedrock services. The architecture is structured into two main components, with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and robust implementation:

1. `bedrock_be`: Infrastructure and services for deploying LLM applications
2. `bedrock_llm`: LLM orchestration and interaction logic

## bedrock_be

The `bedrock_be` component handles all infrastructure and deployment concerns:

- Deployment scripts and configurations for AWS services
- Service management tools for monitoring and scaling
- Integration with AWS services (Lambda, ECS, API Gateway)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates
- Performance monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Security and access control management

## bedrock_llm

The `bedrock_llm` component is organized into several key layers:

### Client Layer (client/)

The Client Layer is the cornerstone of the library's interaction with Amazon Bedrock services. It provides a comprehensive interface with robust features:

#### BaseClient Architecture

##### Core Components

```python
class BaseClient(ABC):
        self.model = self._initialize_model(model_config)
        self.retry_handler = RetryHandler(retry_config)
        self._setup_client(client_config)
```

##### Key Features

1. **Authentication and Session Management**
   - Secure AWS credential handling
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Region configuration
   - Custom endpoint support
   - IAM role management

2. **Retry Logic and Error Handling**
   - Configurable retry strategy
   - Exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker implementation
   - Error classification
   - Request tracking

3. **Memory Management**
   - Conversation history
   - Context optimization
   - Automatic pruning
   - Token management
   - State persistence

#### Specialized Client Implementations

##### AsyncClient

Optimized for high-performance scenarios:

```python
class AsyncClient(BaseClient):
    async def generate_text(self,
                          messages: List[Message],
                          **kwargs) -> Response:
        """Generate text with streaming support"""
        async with self._manage_context():
            response = await self._generate_with_retry(messages, **kwargs)
            return await self._process_response(response)
            
    async def stream_generate(self,
                            messages: List[Message],
                            **kwargs) -> AsyncIterator[Response]:
        """Stream generation results"""
        async for chunk in self._stream_with_retry(messages, **kwargs):
            yield self._process_chunk(chunk)
```

###### Key Features AsyncClient

- Non-blocking operations
- Connection pooling
- Request prioritization
- Stream processing

##### SyncClient

Simplified interface for basic use cases:

```python
class SyncClient(BaseClient):
        """Synchronous text generation"""
        with self._manage_context():
            response = self._generate_with_retry(messages, **kwargs)
            return self._process_response(response)
```

###### Features

- Blocking operations
- Automatic retries
- Batch processing
- Simple integration
- Resource cleanup

##### EmbeddingsClient

Specialized client for vector operations:

```python
class EmbeddingsClient(BaseClient):
    def generate_embeddings(self,
                          texts: List[str],
                          **kwargs) -> List[List[float]]:
        """Generate embeddings for texts"""
        return self._batch_process_embeddings(texts, **kwargs)
```

###### Capabilities
