{%- if TOOLS and TOOLS|length > 0 %}
You have tool calling capabilities. You are given a question and a set of possible functions.
Based on the question, you will need to make one or many function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.
If you can answer the question without any function/tools calls, please do so.
If none of the functions can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.
You should only return the function call in tools call sections.

If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response.

Here is the example:
[example_function1(params_name1=params_value1, ...), example_function2(params_name2=param_values2, ...)]

Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Put the entire function call reply on one line
- Always add your sources when using search results to answer the user query

Here is a list of functions in JSON format that you can invoke:
{%- for tool in TOOLS %}
{{ tool }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}
Here is some example of how to use tools:

What is the weather in New York?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

[get_weather(location="New York")]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>ipython<|end_header_id|>

Tool 1: tools_result: New York is 20*C<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The weather in New York is 20*C

Please continue the conversation.
