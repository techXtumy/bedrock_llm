# Analysis of Retry Logic Implementation

## Current Implementation

The current implementation has two different approaches for retry logic:

1. **generate (sync)**: Uses `_handle_retry_logic_sync` which wraps the entire operation in retry logic from the start.
2. **generate_async (streaming)**: Only applies retry logic when an error occurs, using a try-except pattern.

## Why Refactoring Is Not Recommended

1. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The current async implementation is more efficient because it only activates the retry mechanism when needed
   - Wrapping the entire streaming operation in retry logic (like in generate) would add unnecessary overhead for successful streams
   - The current approach minimizes the complexity of the generator chain when no errors occur

2. **Error Handling Optimization**:
   - The current streaming implementation allows for immediate error detection and handling
   - It preserves the streaming nature of the response while maintaining retry capability
   - The try-except pattern is more suitable for streaming contexts where errors might occur at any point

3. **Code Quality**:
   - While the implementations look different, they are each optimized for their specific use cases
   - The current structure maintains a clear separation between happy path and error handling
   - The implementation is more memory efficient as it doesn't create unnecessary generator wrappers

## Conclusion

While making both implementations look similar might seem appealing for code consistency, it would actually
reduce the efficiency of the async streaming implementation. The current different approaches are
justified by their different use cases and requirements.

The sync version wraps everything in retry logic because it's a single operation, while the async
version only applies retries when needed, which is more appropriate for streaming responses where
you want to minimize overhead in the success path.
