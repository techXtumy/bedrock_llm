   ```

4. Upload your package to PyPI:

   ```

5. Verify the upload by checking the PyPI page for your package:
   <https://pypi.org/project/bedrock-llm/>

6. Update the README.md with the new version number and any new features or changes.

7. Create a new release on GitHub:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Releases"
   - Click "Draft a new release"
   - Tag the release with the version number (e.g., v1.0.1)
   - Add release notes describing the changes

8. Announce the new release to your users through your preferred communication channels.

Remember to increment the version number in `setup.py` for each new release.
